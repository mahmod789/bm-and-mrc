            <p class="section-content-1">
                <p>BMW, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, is a German multinational corporation which produces luxury vehicles and motorcycles. BMW is known for its high-performance cars, elegant design, and cutting-edge technology.</p><p>The history of the BMW Group reaches back to 1916. Today, the four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce, and BMW Motorrad make the BMW Group one of the world’s leading premium suppliers of automobiles, motorcycles, as well as mobility services. Since the beginning of its history, the company has kept its sight firmly set on the future and has consequently put sustainability and efficient resource management into the centre of its strategy. Learn more about the history and historical focus of the BMW Group.
                BMW can trace its roots back to Karl Rapp and Gustav Otto. In 1916, the Flugmaschinenfabrik Gustav Otto company had merged into Bayerische Flugzeug-Werke AG (BFW) at government behest. Elsewhere, in 1917, the Rapp Motorenwerke company became Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH, which was duly converted into an AG (public limited company) in 1918.</p><p> BMW AG subsequently transferred its engine construction operations – including the company and brand names – to BFW in 1922. The date of BFW’s founding, 7 March 1916, has therefore gone down in history as the foundation date of Bayerische Motoren Werke AG.After the Second World War, allied soldiers requisitioned and occupied the BMW plants.</p><p> Since BMW had been classified as an armaments company, machines and tools were dismantled. From 1945 onwards “stopgap” production, mainly of household appliances, was started in Milbertshofen - as was also the case at the Berlin plant.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">About Mercedes-Benz</h2>
            <p class="section-content">Carl Benz is born in Karlsruhe on 25 November 1844. His father dies in July 1846. Despite living on limited financial means, his mother ensures that her son attends a grammar school and later studies mechanical engineering. The young engineer advances quickly from a locksmith to a designer and workshop foreman. In 1871, Carl Benz joins forces with 'mechanician' August Ritter to found his first company, 'Carl Benz and August Ritter, Engineering Workshop', in Mannheim. When Ritter emerges as an unreliable partner, Carl Benz is forced to pay him off using the dowry of his wife, Bertha Ringer, and runs the company alone. From 1878, Carl Benz works intensively on a gas-driven two-stroke engine to realise his vision of a 'vehicle without horses'. After long and laborious attempts, he gets the engine running for the first time on New Year’s Eve in 1879. He founds the 'Gasmotorenfabrik Mannheim' (Mannheim Gas Engine Factory) as a shareholding company in October 1882. Benz’s share in the company amounts to a mere 5 per cent, however, and he has only limited influence in technical areas. His backers are primarily concerned with the safe business of stationary gas engines.</p>
